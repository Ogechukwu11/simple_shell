Project Overview

Our project focuses on building a custom shell, a fundamental tool for interacting with an operating system through text-based commands. Here's a brief overview of our objectives:

1. Shell Functionality: Our custom shell will provide essential features such as executing commands, navigating the file system, and handling input/output.

2. Compatibility: We aim to make our custom shell compatible with standard POSIX shell syntax and behavior, similar to the sh shell.

3. Betty Standard: We are committed to maintaining code quality and readability by adhering to the Betty coding standard, ensuring clean and consistent code.

Getting Started

To use our custom shell, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Build the shell.

3. Run the shell.

Usage:
Our custom shell supports standard shell commands and features, making it familiar to users. You can:

1. Execute commands.
2. Navigate directories.
3. Redirect input/output.
4. Pipe commands.

Example usage:
$ ls -l
$ cd /path/to/directory
$ echo "Hello, world!" > output.txt
$ cat input.txt | grep "keyword"
